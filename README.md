## Easy Dropper

When Droppers contain items, they will automatically dispense. Unless they are powered by resstone.

You can modify the trajectory of the dispensed items to make them land in a fixed position.

### Automatic Dropper

The dropper will periodically dispense item if it has. The dispensing frequency can be customized by modifying the cooldown.

**Redstone power will stop it!(Like Hopper).**

When enabled, the landing position of each item are no longer random. They are accurately calculated based on the value specified by players.
